### Build
To install build dependencies, run `npm install`, which will also trigger a build afterward. Built files can be found in the `lib/` subdirectory.

Run the example page locally with `npm run example:watch`. Changes to source or documentation files will cause the browser to reload automatically.

Open `localhost:1234` in a web browser to see the live-updated page.
